#### Getting Started

Create a new project in the `Projects` section.

##### Combine data

The application combines data files for purposes of a statistical analysis. Once you have completed the process, you can download or save the file to be viewed and utilized by others (see the `Collaborators` section of application).

Check-out our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQb8_glKoFjXi1a5Hq4K7wA) to see our online demo.

##### Criteria

The data files must each have a field that identifies the subjects of your study. For now, the data must be in a `.csv` or `.tsv` format.  Finally, the first row of the data must contain the field names.  The names can be changed in the application.

##### Sequence of steps

Start by importing the data to include in the analysis.  The `Stepper` at the bottom of the screen will guide you through the process.

#### Data security

The data is only ever viewed by you and the people you chose to invite to your project. The original data is not changed ("read-only").  The data is cached on our servers.  Once you delete a project, all of the data associated with the project is removed from our servers the servers.


#### Working with colleagues

If you are the owner of a project, you can invite others to join.  All users with access to a project can add new data sources. This can be particularly helpful when working with data that is hosted or managed by others.
