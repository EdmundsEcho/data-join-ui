Use the drag and drop facility to select the data required for the
analysis.

The subject `Qualities` are used to select which subjects to include in the data.  The default is to include them all. The selected qualities determine the `Subject universe`.

The `Measurements` are used to describe the subjects over time. A measurement can be used several times. Measurements can be reported either as a summary value ("rollup"), or as a repeated "series".  Measurements can also be used to create a derived quality.

There are three "drop-zones". They are used to visually organize the data.
