2. use-fetch-api
3. use-shared-fetch-api

The setup involves a sophisticated use of React hooks to manage data fetching, normalization, pagination, and potentially other transformations before updating the local state of a component hosting a DataGrid. Let's break down how each layer of hooks contributes to the functionality and how they interact to provide a streamlined data management pipeline for the grid-hosting component.

### The Hook Layers

1.  **`useFetchApi` Hook**: This is the foundational layer that handles the asynchronous fetching of data. It encapsulates the logic for making API calls, managing request states (pending, resolved, rejected), handling cancellations, and optionally processing data upon receipt.

    - **Responsibilities**:
      - Initiates the fetch operation based on provided arguments and an abort signal for cancellation capabilities.
      - Updates the fetch state and cache with the response from the asynchronous operation.
      - Handles immediate execution control and cancellation logic.
      - Provides an interface (`execute`, `cancel`, `reset`) to trigger fetch operations, cancel ongoing requests, or reset the state, respectively.

2.  **`useSharedFetchApi` Hook**: Acts as a middleware that orchestrates the fetching process, including error handling, redirections based on fetch responses, and state updates through dispatch actions.

    - **Responsibilities**:
      - Manages a more granular state of the fetch operation, including handling notices, redirection URLs, and specific fetch arguments.
      - Utilizes `useReducer` for state management to handle complex state transitions based on fetch operation outcomes.
      - Interacts with global or external contexts, such as displaying notifications or redirecting users.

3.  **`usePagination` Hook**: Builds upon the lower-level fetch hooks to implement pagination logic. It manages pagination state, such as page indices and cursor positions, and integrates the fetching mechanism with pagination-specific behaviors.

    - **Responsibilities**:
      - Maintains pagination state, including page size, current page index, and cursor for fetch operations.
      - Uses `useEffect` to respond to changes in pagination filters or other parameters that necessitate data re-fetching.
      - Normalizes fetched data as needed before updating the local component state, providing a mechanism for post-fetch data processing.
      - Provides pagination controls (e.g., `fetchNextPage`, `fetchPreviousPage`) and the ability to reset pagination state or adjust page size dynamically.

### Interactions and Data Flow

- **Data Fetching and State Management**: The `useFetchApi` hook initiates data fetching based on parameters provided by the `usePagination` hook. Upon successful data retrieval, it updates its local state with the fetched data (and optionally normalized data) and then informs the `usePagination` hook of the update.

- **Pagination Controls**: The `usePagination` hook offers pagination control methods that update the fetch parameters (like the cursor or page index). These updates trigger re-fetches through the `useFetchApi` hook to retrieve the corresponding data slice.

- **Normalization and Post-processing**: Before updating its local state with new data, the `usePagination` hook can apply normalization or other post-processing steps to the fetched data, ensuring that the data format meets the grid-hosting component's requirements.

- **State Synchronization and Updates**: The grid-hosting component relies on the `usePagination` hook for its data needs. It consumes the paginated, normalized data and any control mechanisms (like pagination controls) exposed by the hook. This setup centralizes data fetching and processing logic within the hook, minimizing the component's responsibility to merely presenting the data.

### Conclusion

This layered hook architecture allows for a clean separation of concerns, where each hook has a specific responsibility, from low-level fetching and error handling to pagination management and data normalization. The grid-hosting component benefits from this abstraction by receiving a well-defined interface to fetch, process, and display data with minimal internal logic, leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.
